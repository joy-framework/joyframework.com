<p>Whatâ€™s the point of learning a new language, especially a lisp, in 2020? Well, there is no point! Weâ€™ve past the point of points.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a little breakdown of 5 features that might make you at least a little interested.</p>

<ol>
<li>Itâ€™s a lisp!</li>
<li>It has immutability</li>
<li>Starts up instantly</li>
<li>Requires very little memory</li>
<li>Small, but dedicated community</li>
</ol>

<h2>Itâ€™s a lisp</h2>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp_cycles.png" alt="xkcd says so"></p>

<p>The oldest, best-est programming language lives on, just like that classic XKCD comic says! Yay!</p>

<h2>It has immutability</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s not quite as pervasive as clojure, but it has functions and data structures like tuples/arrays (indexed in-order things) and structs/tables (hash maps/dictionaries)</p>

<h2>It starts up instantly</h2>

<p>Unlike some other lisp that wonâ€™t be named, <a href="https://janet-lang.org">janet</a> starts up instantly and it can compile code to cross platform native executables!</p>

<h2>Requires very little memory</h2>

<p>You can usually create a whole web app and have it running in under 4 MB of memory and idling at almost 0CPU.</p>

<h2>Small but dedicated community</h2>

<p>The community is very active, helpful and growing! Super friendly and can usually answer any questions you might have in the <a href="https://gitter.im/janet-language/community">gitter chat room</a></p>
