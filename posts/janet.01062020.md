What’s the point of learning a new language, especially a lisp, in 2020? Well, there is no point! We’ve past the point of points.

Here’s a little breakdown of 5 features that might make you at least a little interested.

1. It’s a lisp!
2. It has immutability
3. Starts up instantly
4. Requires very little memory
5. Small, but dedicated community

## It’s a lisp
![xkcd says so](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp_cycles.png)

The oldest, best-est programming language lives on, just like that classic XKCD comic says! Yay!

## It has immutability
It’s not quite as pervasive as clojure, but it has functions and data structures like tuples/arrays (indexed in-order things) and structs/tables (hash maps/dictionaries)

## It starts up instantly
Unlike some other lisp that won’t be named, [janet](https://janet-lang.org) starts up instantly and it can compile code to cross platform native executables!

## Requires very little memory
You can usually create a whole web app and have it running in under 4 MB of memory and idling at almost 0% CPU.

## Small but dedicated community
The community is very active, helpful and growing! Super friendly and can usually answer any questions you might have in the [gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/janet-language/community)
